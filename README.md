# How often is 1st January a Monday?

Answer...less often than it is every other day except Saturday

No I don't know why. This is written up [on my blog](https://edjohnsonwilliams.co.uk/2018/01/02/how-often-is-1st-january-a-monday.html) with graphs etc but here's the main data.

## From the year 1 AD to 2018

| Day of week | Times 1st Jan has been X day | Avg years to wait |
| --- | :---: | :---: |
| Monday | 283 | 7.15 |
| Tuesday | 293 | 6.89 |
| Wednesday | 287 | 7.03 |
| Thursday | 288 | 7.01 |
| Friday | 292 | 6.89 |
| Saturday | 282 | 7.14 |
| Sunday | 293 | 6.89 |

## From the year 1 AD to 9999

Just to test that a bit further I tried it from 1AD to the year 9999 as well. (9999 is the maximum year Python can work with in its standard library.) The results are as good as exactly the same.

| Day of week | Times 1st Jan has been X day | Avg years to wait |
| --- | :---: | :---: |
| Monday | 1400 | 7.14 |
| Tuesday | 1450 | 6.89 |
| Wednesday | 1425 | 7.02 |
| Thursday | 1425 | 7.02 |
| Friday | 1450 | 6.89 |

| Sunday | 1450 | 6.89 |
